# lanlanalysis
I completed this work to demonstrate my skills in security, cobbling together solutions and data science.
This submission contains three parts.
1. An email that could be used to convince the grader that I have discovered a new & unique algorythm and approach. The suggested , but not built, backing website at connections.lonl.org would contain the full monthly newsletter along with rare praise for the character, talent and insight of Robert Sullivan.
2. HTML, R Markdown files and PNG files (SullivansLANLProject2) that demonstrate preprocessing and model building with the LANL data set. Using a Generalized Linear Model I built a system that reached 80% accuracy in training and 85% in testing.
3. A hadoop constructed input file and screen shots (snowballinput.*) that computes the "snowball" rating for each user. This shows parts of a 4-cluster Hadoop system using Cloudera, Hive and Hue to compute a new predictor on the full auth.txt log file, 71GB when expanded.

This work took a significant effort. Please send your comments and suggestions to me: msp.sullivan@gmail.com.
