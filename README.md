# LANL Analysis
I completed this work to demonstrate my skills in security, cobbling together solutions and data science.

This submission contains three parts.

1. HTML, R Markdown files and PNG files [HTML Project File](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/mspsullivan/lanlanalysis/blob/master/SullivansLANLProject2.html) and a chart [New Edge Chart](https://github.com/mspsullivan/lanlanalysis/blob/master/SullivanLANLProject2EdgeByDay.png) that demonstrate preprocessing and model building with the LANL data set. Using a Generalized Linear Model I built a system that reached 80% accuracy in training and 85% in testing.  
2. A hadoop constructed input file and screen shots [Cloudera Manager](https://github.com/mspsullivan/lanlanalysis/blob/master/SnowballinputHue.png) and [Hue]() that computes the "snowball" rating for each user. This shows parts of a 4-cluster Hadoop system using Cloudera, Hive and Hue to compute a new predictor on the full auth.txt log file, 71GB when expanded.
3. An email that could be used to convince the grader that I have discovered a new & unique algorythm and approach. The suggested , but not built, backing website at connections.lonl.org would contain the full monthly newsletter along with rare praise for the character, talent and insight of Robert Sullivan.

This work took a significant effort. Please send your comments and suggestions to me: msp.sullivan@gmail.com.
